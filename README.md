## A brief historic analysis of the World Cup:

The FIFA World Cup is a football tournament celebrated every 4 years, where teams from different countries all over the world compete to win the most prestigious award in all of football. With the help of our dataframe we'll be able to see the evolution of the popularity of the World Cup through the years. Has the world of football grown in the last century?. Is the World Cup a good event to invest in given the current situation we live in with limited mobility to travel?.

We'll also use statistical testing in order to understand how likely is a penalty shootout to happen depending on the previous results of the game, meaning how probable is a penalty shootout during the World Cup. Also we'll test for the relation between the host country reaching the final of the tournament, given how playing locally may be considered an advantage.



And finally, thanks to our dataset we'll learn some interesting trivia facts about the World Cup, for example:

  * Which country has the most amount of wins on the full time of the game?
  * Which countries have hosted the World Cup the most?
  * What has been the stadium with the biggest capacity in all the World Cups?
  * Which stages attract the most amount of people?
  * Which country has the better referees?
